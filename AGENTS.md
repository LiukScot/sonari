## Sonari — repo-specific rules

**Stack:** Android · Kotlin · Jetpack Compose · Media3/ExoPlayer · minSdk 24.
The synced rules below are written for web/TypeScript projects — where they
mention CSS/TS/SQL/HTML/i18n, read them as the nearest Kotlin/Compose
equivalent. On conflict, these personal rules win.

### Design / theme
- Visual tokens live in `Sonari Design System/` (a CSS/React **reference
  spec**) and are *ported* to Compose under `ui/theme/` (`Color.kt`,
  `Shape.kt`, `Type.kt`). Never hardcode a hex or a literal `.dp` in a
  composable — reference the token object.
- The accent gradient `#9b8cff → #ff8fb1` is a Compose `Brush`, not a `Color`.
  Use it **only on large elements** (play button, active card, slider fill,
  selected tile). Small icons/text use the solid accent `#c69bff`.
- Single dark "twilight" theme, no switcher. Do not add light-mode colors.
  (Material You dynamic color is a deferred future toggle — see PLAN.md §10.)

### Audio
- Loops use **Media3 ExoPlayer** (`REPEAT_MODE_ONE`), one player per sound,
  created **lazily** on first play. Never `SoundPool` or `MediaPlayer` for
  long loops — they click audibly at the loop point.
- Build players with `handleAudioFocus = true` so playback ducks/stops for
  calls and other apps.
- Playback state is one source of truth (`canPlay: StateFlow<Boolean>` + the
  active sounds) reachable from the UI **and** the Service/Tile via a static
  holder — the Tile owns no state of its own.

### Service / Quick Tile
- Background playback is a Media3 `MediaSessionService` run as a foreground
  service (`foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"`). Without it Android kills
  audio when the screen is off.
- The Quick Tile can fire when the app process is dead. The last mix **must**
  be persisted (DataStore) and reloaded by the service on cold start — test
  this path explicitly.

### Platform
- `minSdk 24`. Guard any newer API behind a version check: `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
  (33), dynamic color (31). The QS tile API (24) needs no guard.
- User-facing copy follows the design-system voice: **sentence case, no emoji
  in product UI**, calm and plain. Strings go in `res/values/strings.xml`,
  English only.

### Licensing
- GPL-3.0 repo. Built-in sounds are **CC0 from Blanket** — verify each file's
  license before bundling it.
- Do not copy code from `blankee` / `Easy Noise` (incompatible licenses /
  other packages). Replicate the *patterns*, write our own implementation.

# Agent instructions

These rules apply to every code change in this repository.

Goals: keep the codebase consistent, surface bugs early, give PR
reviewers (human or AI) a concrete checklist of what to verify.

PR review uses this file. A PR that violates a rule below should be
flagged or rejected with a reference to the rule it breaks.

---

## 0. How to approach work

These rules govern *how* you work, not *what* you write. They apply
before any of the rules below.

- **Surface assumptions before coding**. State them explicitly. If
  the request has 2+ plausible interpretations and the code would
  differ, stop and ask one clarifying question. Don't pick silently.
- **Plan multi-step tasks with verify steps**. State the plan as
  `step → verify`. Strong success criteria let the work loop
  without constant clarification.
- **Bug fix = test first**. Write a failing test that reproduces
  the bug, then make it pass. Same pattern for "make X validate":
  write the test for invalid input, then implement.
- **Push back if a simpler approach exists**. The user is not
  always right about scope or implementation. If the request can
  be solved with less code or a different angle, say so before
  building.

## 1. Before writing code

- Read what already exists. Find a sibling file solving a similar
  problem and copy its structure, naming, and patterns.
- Match the prefix conventions of nearby code. If components are
  named `dash-*`, do not introduce `widget-*`.
- Do not introduce a new layer, abstraction, or directory unless the
  problem cannot be expressed with what is already here.

## 2. Style and design system

- Spacing, color, typography, surface come from the project's design
  tokens (CSS variables, theme files, Tailwind config, design system
  page). Use the existing tokens. Do not add ad-hoc px/rem, hex, or
  one-off media queries.
- Do not introduce `calc(...)` for spacing. Pick a token that fits
  the rhythm; if none fits, ask before adding a new token.
- Reuse shared utility classes before creating new ones. Search the
  existing prefix conventions (`.dash-*`, `.detail-*`, `.status-*`,
  whatever this repo uses) and reuse the selector.
- Dark mode: any new color rule either uses tokens that auto-adapt
  or has a `:root[data-theme="dark"]` (or equivalent) counterpart.
  Raw hex breaks dark mode.

## 3. Code organization

- Keep files under ~500 lines. Split by concern, not line count.
- No helpers, factories, or wrappers for hypothetical future needs.
  Add them when there are at least three concrete callers.

## 4. Error handling

- Validate input only at system boundaries: HTTP endpoints, CLI
  args, message queue payloads, file uploads, third-party API
  responses. Internal modules trust each other.
- Never silent-catch. Every `catch` either re-throws, returns an
  explicit error result, or logs with enough context to diagnose.
  Empty catch block = bug.
- Do not add fallbacks for "shouldn't happen" branches. Let the
  code crash visibly with a useful message. Hidden recovery hides
  bugs.
- Do not wrap code that cannot throw in `try/catch`.

## 5. Type safety (TypeScript projects)

- No `any` without an inline `// reason: ...` comment explaining
  why a narrower type is impossible.
- No `// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-nocheck` in new code. Fix the type.
- Validate boundary inputs at runtime (zod, valibot, manual
  guards). Type assertions are not validation.
- Prefer `unknown` to `any` when the input shape is genuinely
  unknown.

## 6. Imports and dependencies

- Do not add a dependency for what 5 lines of stdlib do.
- Before adding a package, search existing `dependencies` for
  something that already covers it.
- Commit the lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `bun.lock`,
  `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `go.sum`, `composer.lock`). Do not delete it.
- Do not downgrade a package without a written reason in the commit
  body.
- Do not pin to a tarball URL or git ref unless no npm-published
  alternative exists. CDN/git deps bypass Dependabot.
- Keep dependencies on their latest stable release. Configure
  Dependabot/Renovate to open PRs for every bump (patch, minor,
  major). Review and merge promptly — sitting on old versions
  accumulates risk and migration debt. Don't park a dep on an old
  major "because it works"; either bump or open an issue tracking
  the blocker.

## 7. Comments

- Default: write no comment.
- Comment only when the *why* is non-obvious: a workaround for a
  specific bug, a hidden invariant, a counter-intuitive choice.
- Do not explain *what* the code does. Identifier names and types
  already do that.
- Do not write comments that reference the current task, ticket, or
  PR ("added for issue #42", "TODO before merge"). Those rot. Put
  them in the PR description.
- Never commit `console.log`, `print`, `debug!`, `dd()`, leftover
  debugger statements.

## 8. Commits

- Subject uses Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`,
  `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `security:`,
  `build:`, `style:`. Subject ≤ 72 chars.
- Subject is imperative ("add", "fix", not "added", "fixed").
- Body explains *why*, not *what*. Wrap at 72 chars.
- Reference issues with `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` so they auto-close.
- Never `--no-verify` to skip hooks.
- Do not amend commits that have been pushed and merged or reviewed.

## 9. Tests

- New non-trivial logic gets a test. Trivial = no branches, no I/O.
- Test the contract (input → output), not the implementation. Tests
  that mirror the code break on every refactor.
- Mock only at system boundaries (network, FS, time, randomness, DB
  driver). Mocking your own modules tests the mock, not the code.
- Fix flaky tests; do not retry-loop them. Flake = real bug.
- Tests needing network or a live DB go in an integration suite,
  not a unit suite.

## 10. Security

- No secrets in code, committed env files, comments, fixtures, log
  output, or commit messages. `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`
  are never committed.
- SQL: parametrize. Never string-concat user input into queries.
- HTML output: escape by default. Only opt out for explicitly
  trusted values, with a comment naming the source.
- Redirects: validate the target against an allowlist. Open
  redirect is a phishing primitive.
- File upload: validate MIME, size, and extension server-side.
  Never trust client-reported `Content-Type`.
- CSRF: state-changing endpoints require a CSRF token (or
  `SameSite=Strict` cookie + Origin check) unless documented as
  public.
- PII / personal data in logs: redact. Email, phone, full IP,
  user-supplied free text — none of these belong in production
  logs unredacted.

## 11. Database and migrations

- A schema change is a new migration file. Never edit a migration
  that has been merged.
- Migrations are reversible (up + down) when feasible. Document the
  why if a migration is one-way.
- No destructive operations (`DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`, `DELETE`
  without `WHERE`, `TRUNCATE`) without explicit user direction.
- Add an index for new foreign keys and for columns used in
  frequent `WHERE` / `ORDER BY`.
- Do not run migrations from application code at startup unless the
  project has decided to. Prefer a separate migrate step.

## 12. Performance

- No N+1: prefer `JOIN` or batch fetch over a per-item query in a
  loop.
- Do not load entire tables into memory. Paginate.
- Profile before optimizing. No micro-optimizations without a
  measured bottleneck.
- Cache only after measuring. Caches add bugs (staleness,
  invalidation, memory pressure); they earn their place by removing
  measured cost.

## 13. Async and concurrency

- Every Promise is awaited or explicitly `void`'d with a comment
  ("// fire and forget: logging, ok to drop").
- Pass `AbortSignal` through long-running async functions where the
  caller might cancel.
- Do not `setTimeout`/`setInterval` without a clear cleanup path
  (component unmount, server shutdown, etc).
- No `await` inside a tight loop if the operation is parallelizable.
  Use `Promise.all` / `Promise.allSettled`.

## 14. CI and workflows

- Every workflow has a top-level `permissions:` block. Default to
  `contents: read`. Widen per-job only when needed.
- Track third-party actions at their latest stable tag (`@v4`).
  Dependabot bumps the tag when a new major lands; review the
  changelog and merge. Pin to SHA only when an action's repo has had
  a tag-moving incident.
- Never interpolate user-controlled input directly into `run:`
  blocks. Pipe through `env:`:

  ```yaml
  env:
    BODY: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
  run: echo "$BODY"
  ```

  `${{ github.event.issue.body }}` placed directly in `run:` is
  shell injection.
- Do not skip CI hooks (`--no-verify`, `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`)
  without an explicit reason in the PR description.
- Every new test added must run in a CI job, and every new CI job that gates correctness must be added to `main`'s required status checks in the same PR 

## 15. Accessibility (frontend)

- Form inputs: every input has `name`, `id`, `type`, and a matching
  `<label for="...">`. Add `autocomplete` where the field maps to
  a standard token (`email`, `current-password`, `tel`, etc).
- Interactive elements: `<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>` — never a
  `<div>` with `onClick`. Keyboard users cannot reach `<div
  onClick>`.
- Do not remove `aria-*` attributes when refactoring. They are
  there for a reason; ask before deleting.
- Color is never the only signal. Always pair with icon, text, or
  shape.
- Image `alt` text is mandatory. Decorative images use `alt=""`.

## 16. Internationalization (frontend)

- Do not hardcode user-facing strings if the repo has an i18n
  helper (`t()`, `i18n`, `useTranslation`, etc). Find it and use
  it.
- Date and number formatting goes through the locale-aware
  formatter, not `toString`.

## 17. Dead code

- Delete unused imports, exports, parameters, variables, and files
  in the same PR that makes them unused.
- Do not leave "commented-out for later" code. `git log` keeps
  history; commented blocks rot.
- Do not leave `TODO` or `FIXME` without a name and a ticket
  reference. Anonymous TODOs are abandoned by tomorrow.

## 18. Documentation

- Update README only when the change is visible to users (CLI
  flags, install steps, env vars, breaking API).
- Do not write README aimed at first-time PR reviewers. They have
  `git log` and the code. Aim docs at users.
- API docs (OpenAPI, JSDoc, GoDoc) are kept in sync with the code
  in the same PR. Stale docs are worse than no docs.
